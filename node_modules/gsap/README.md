# GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)

#### Ultra high-performance, professional-grade animation for the modern web

GSAP is a JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations that work in **every** major browser. No other library delivers such advanced sequencing, reliability, API efficiency, and tight control while solving real-world problems on over 4 million sites. GSAP works around countless browser inconsistencies; your animations 'just work'. CSS properties, SVG, canvas libraries, custom properties of generic objects, colors, strings...animate anything! At its core, GSAP is a high-speed property manipulator, updating values over time with extreme accuracy. It's up to 20x faster than jQuery! See the <a href="https://greensock.com/why-gsap/">"Why GSAP?"</a> article for what makes GSAP so special.

Unlike monolithic frameworks that dictate how you structure your apps, GSAP is completely flexible; sprinkle it wherever you want. React, Vue, Angular or vanilla JS - doesn't matter. Simply put, GSAP is the most robust high-performance animation library on the planet, which is probably why **every major ad network excludes it from file size calculations**.

**Zero dependencies.**

This is the public repository for GreenSock's JavaScript tools like <a href="https://greensock.com/gsap/" target="_blank">GSAP</a> and <a href="https://greensock.com/draggable/" target="_blank">Draggable</a>. "GSAP" describes all of the animation-related tools which include TweenLite, TweenMax, TimelineLite, TimelineMax, various <a href="https://greensock.com/plugins/?product_id=4921">plugins</a>, extra <a href="https://greensock.com/ease-visualizer/">easing</a> functions, etc. 

### CDN
TweenMax is most popular because it has all the essential tools plus several common <a href="https://greensock.com/plugins/?product_id=4921">plugins</a>, all in one file:
```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/2.0.1/TweenMax.min.js"></script>
```
Click the green "Download GSAP" button at <a href="https://greensock.com/?download=GSAP-JS">greensock.com</a> for more options. Click "customize" at the bottom of the resulting window to see all the extra plugins and tool URLs. 

Draggable, for example, is at:
```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/2.0.1/utils/Draggable.min.js"></script>
```

Most ad networks have GSAP on their CDNs as well, so contact them for the appropriate URL(s). 

### NPM
See the <a href="https://greensock.com/docs/NPMUsage">full guide to using GSAP via NPM</a>.

```javascript
npm install gsap
```
The default (main) file is TweenMax which includes TweenLite, TimelineLite, TimelineMax, all of the eases (except CustomEase/CustomWiggle/CustomBounce) and the following plugins: css, roundProps, bezier, attr, and directionalRotation. 
```javascript
//typical import
import {TweenMax, Power2, TimelineLite} from "gsap/TweenMax";

//or get to the parts that aren't included inside TweenMax:
import Draggable from "gsap/Draggable";
import ScrollToPlugin from "gsap/ScrollToPlugin";

//or, as of 2.0.0, all tools are exported from the "all" file (excluding bonus plugins):
import {TweenMax, CSSPlugin, ScrollToPlugin, Draggable, Elastic} from "gsap/all";
//if tree shaking dumps plugins, just reference them somewhere in your code like:
const plugins = [CSSPlugin, ScrollToPlugin]; 
```
As of version 2.0.0, the NPM files are ES modules, though there's also a /umd/ directory with UMD files for extra compatibility.

For <a href="https://greensock.com/club/">Club GreenSock</a>-only plugins, download them from your GreenSock.com account and then treat them as part of your own JS payload or drop them into your node_modules/gsap folder. Post other questions in our <a href="https://greensock.com/forums/">forums</a> and we'd be happy to help.
